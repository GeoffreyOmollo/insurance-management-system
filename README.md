# Insurance Policy Management System

This project is an Insurance Policy Management System using Angular and C# (.NET).

## Features

- Add, edit, delete and view insurance coverages. Coverages are the things that a given insurance will cover
- Add, edit, delete and view insurance exclusions. Exclusions are the things that a given insurance will not cover
- Add, edit, delete and view insurance types. These are the different insurances that a person (policy holder) can choose and apply for. An insurance type specifies its insurance coverage and insurance exclusion.
- Add, edit, delete and view the insurance policies. An insurance policy has the policy holder's name, the insurance type for the policy holder, the amount the policy holder is deducted monthly and the policy limit amount (the maximum amount the insurance company will pay out under the policy)

## Tech Stack Used

## Some Theory

Insurance policies are legal agreements between an individual or entity (the policyholder) and an insurance company. These agreements provide financial protection against specific risks or losses in exchange for regular payments called premiums. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Key Components of Insurance Policies
- Premium: The amount the policyholder pays to the insurance company, usually monthly or annually. The premium amount depends on factors like the type of insurance, coverage level, risk factors, and personal details (e.g., age, health).

- Policyholder: The person or entity who owns the policy and is entitled to coverage benefits.

- Insured: The individual or property covered under the policy. Sometimes, the policyholder and the insured are the same (e.g., life insurance), but not always (e.g., a parent insures their child).

- Coverage: The specific risks or events that the insurance policy protects against, such as car accidents, health issues, property damage, or death.

- Deductible: The amount the policyholder must pay out-of-pocket before the insurance company covers the remaining costs. For example, in car insurance, if the deductible is $500, the policyholder must pay the first $500 of a repair bill.

- Policy Limit: The maximum amount the insurance company will pay out under the policy. For example, a life insurance policy may have a $500,000 limit.

- Exclusions: Specific situations or types of damage that are not covered by the policy. For instance, a homeowners insurance policy might exclude damages caused by floods or earthquakes.

- Beneficiary: In life insurance, the person or entity designated to receive the payout upon the policyholder's death.

### Types of Insurance

#### Life Insurance
Purpose: Provides financial support to beneficiaries after the policyholder's death.

Term Life Insurance: Coverage for a specific period.
Whole Life Insurance: Coverage for the policyholder's lifetime and may include an investment component.

#### Health Insurance

Types: Employer-provided, individual, or government plans (e.g., Medicare).

#### Auto Insurance

#### Homeowners Insurance
Purpose: Protects against damage or loss to a home and its contents due to events like fires or theft.
Additional Riders: Flood or earthquake insurance may be added for extra protection.

#### Renters Insurance
Purpose: Protects personal belongings in a rented property and provides liability coverage.

#### Disability Insurance
Purpose: Provides income replacement if the policyholder becomes unable to work due to a disability.

#### Travel Insurance
Purpose: Covers unexpected expenses during travel, such as trip cancellations, medical emergencies, or lost luggage.

#### Business Insurance
Purpose: Protects businesses against risks like property damage, liability claims, and employee-related risks.
