# Insurance Policy Management System

This project is an Insurance Policy Management System using Angular and C# (.NET).

- Add, edit, delete and view insurance types. These are the different insurances that a person (policy holder) can choose and apply for. An insurance type specifies its insurance coverage and insurance exclusion.

## Some Theory

Insurance policies are legal agreements between an individual or entity (the policyholder) and an insurance company. These agreements provide financial protection against specific risks or losses in exchange for regular payments called premiums. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Key Components of Insurance Policies
- Premium: The amount the policyholder pays to the insurance company, usually monthly or annually. The premium amount depends on factors like the type of insurance, coverage level, risk factors, and personal details (e.g., age, health).

- Policyholder: The person or entity who owns the policy and is entitled to coverage benefits.

- Insured: The individual or property covered under the policy. Sometimes, the policyholder and the insured are the same (e.g., life insurance), but not always (e.g., a parent insures their child).

- Coverage: The specific risks or events that the insurance policy protects against, such as car accidents, health issues, property damage, or death.

- Deductible: The amount the policyholder must pay out-of-pocket before the insurance company covers the remaining costs. For example, in car insurance, if the deductible is $500, the policyholder must pay the first $500 of a repair bill.

- Policy Limit: The maximum amount the insurance company will pay out under the policy. For example, a life insurance policy may have a $500,000 limit.

- Exclusions: Specific situations or types of damage that are not covered by the policy. For instance, a homeowners insurance policy might exclude damages caused by floods or earthquakes.

- Beneficiary: In life insurance, the person or entity designated to receive the payout upon the policyholder's death.
